The Medicine Reminder App is a user-centric web application designed to help individuals manage their daily medication schedules effectively. A critical component of the application is the authentication system, which ensures that each user has a personalized and secure experience.
This module provides a clean and interactive Sign In / Sign Up interface, allowing users to register using their name, email, and password, and log in securely. The interface is developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, offering a responsive and user-friendly experience.
In the full application, after authentication, users can:
•	Add and manage their medicines (name, dosage, time).
•	Receive reminders to take their medicines.
•	Track doses taken or missed.
•	Alert family or caregivers if medicines are missed multiple times.
The Sign In/Sign Up module ensures data privacy, personalized tracking, and secure access, forming the foundation for the medicine reminder system’s functionality.
